# TestNG
TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language created by CÃ©dric Beust and inspired by JUnit and NUnit. The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc., with more powerful and easy-to-use functionalities.
